## JavaScript
Js is a compiled programming language with first-class functions. Js is completely different from Java programming that have very different syntax, semantics, and use. 

## Variables; Different ways to declare them
* var --> old way
* none
* let --> can be changed
* const --> constant can **NOT** be changed

## Variable identifiers 
* Case sensitive 
* Contains letter, digits, $, _
* Begins with letter

## Control flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines promptUser and submitForm could also be calls to other functions in the script.
