# Growth mindset 
<sup> Ahmed Mohamed </sup>
### My Thoughts
Growth mindset is believeing hardwork can persevere over god given talent. Intellect and talent can key components in someones success; but just because you lack it doesn't mean you can't train yourself to get there.

> A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
