## Java Funtion
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)

## Expression

t a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.**


** Const x = 2 +2 * 4**
** const y = 4 * 2 + 2**

They both equal 8 just worded diffrently. Despite * and + coming in different orders, both expressions would result in 8 because * has precedence over +, so the *-joined expression will always be evaluated first.
